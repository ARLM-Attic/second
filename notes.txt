Before I design classes, let's get a grip on how it will work.

I loved the talent mechanic from last time.  It seemed like too much at the time, but recent games I've played make me feel like it was pretty good.  The only thing that's maybe not right is the purchasing/selling mechanics of it, but I should be able to do something about that.  I think I like the tokens, but you should get them for completing new battles too.  (As well as purchasing, at an escalating cost.)

I loved the mana as power thing, but I'd like to tweak it a bit.
In league, armor is done by.. adding points of virtual health.  I like that.  So maybe something like..

For damage:  c * P * * 100/(100 + D)

Neat.  I like this way better.  Especially since it lets me accelerate damage output a LOT.
